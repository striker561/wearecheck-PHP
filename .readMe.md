**Getting The JSON Data from API**

Having using postman to run the JSON placeholder API, i observed the data that was provided in the endpoint of posts, comments, albums, photos, to-dos and users. Now mapping and building the relationship remains. From the look of things it goes like:

1. User -> to-dos
2. User -> Posts -> Comments 
3. User -> Albums -> Photos

With this the relationship between the data is completed and all data source has been accounted for. I also noticed that we have some major foreign key used; userId,  albumId, postId.

We have to recreate the data and store it in the database, with the primary key a **ULID**. I am using a package to generate the key, as a composer package exists for it. it reduces development time instead of reinventing the wheel by recreating what already exists.


**Whats Next**
After defining my database schema, defining relationships, foreign keys and creating the data file that helps me access the database more effectively. Its time to import the data from the API call into the application. I created a Route Class to mimic the way Laravel handles API calls, and Routes or Controller to process the requests and give users an out put. There i will define 
1. The route for initializing the app the first time by importing the data 
2. The route for interacting with the data imported

**Importing Data**
This is a large data set so it would be bad to import it and loop through it in every function we need to offload the whole data to the database in a single query.
We should note that we are dealing with some large data set and we have to free up some variables especially in lookup maps after they are done. 
The look up map is used to convert the id to ULID.


**Sorting and Looking up Data** 
I made use of pagination and offset to create paginate data without any filter, if you are searching a record based on, lets say if todo is completed or not, its not paginated, if you are getting the whole todo data its paginated. A post man file would be provided with routes and parameters supported.
